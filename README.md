### Hi there I'm Chukwuemeka👋
I specialize in backend development and AI agent workflows, primarily using Python, JavaScript, and Go. I thrive in fast-paced, evolving environments and am comfortable working both independently and within collaborative teams. My recent focus has been on building AI-integrated systems, especially leveraging LLMs for automation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and agent-based architecture. I bring a problem-solving mindset, eagerness to learn, and a strong drive to contribute to high-impact projects.
