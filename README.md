### Hi there I'm Chukwuemeka👋
I've always found it interesting being able to scrape as much information as you want from the internet. For a while i've dabbling across several tech stack ranging from frontend, mobile, blockchain, backend but along side, I was still actively involved in webscrapping up until I stumbled upon the field of Data Engineering then it clicked and seemed just right being able to help people create or maintain their Data architecture using my favorite language Python.
